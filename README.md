Air BNB Analysis

Project looking at all the Air BNB listings for New York. I took the raw data provided by Air BNB, cleaned it, converted it to a Database using SSMS, and used that to create aggregations to paint a better picture of the market segment for rentals. With the data I was able to find great deals on which Borough I wanted to stay at with varied specifications (1 or 2 bed, shared living space, location, etc).
